What is a paradigma?
--------------------------------------
[Structured programming] (https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/structured-programming-modular-programming) sometimes known as modular programmingis a programming paradigm that facilitates the creation of programs with readable code and reusable components. All modern programming languages support structured programming, but the mechanisms of support, like the syntax of the programming languages, varies.

Where modules or elements of code can be reused from a library, it may also be possible to build structured code using modules written in different languages, as long as they can obey a common module interface or application program interface (API) specification. However, when modules are reused, it's possible to compromise data security and governance, so it's important to define and enforce a privacy policy controlling the use of modules that bring with them implicit data access rights.
According with TechTarget:
> Structured programming encourages dividing an application program into a hierarchy of modules or autonomous elements, which may, in turn, contain other such elements. Within each element, code may be further structured using blocks of related logic designed to improve readability and maintainability. These may include case, which tests a variable against a set of values; Repeat, while and for, which construct loops that continue until a condition is met. In all structured programming languages, an unconditional transfer of control, or goto statement, is deprecated and sometimes not even available.    

Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features.
#Declarative: 
Programming by specifying the result you want, not how to get it. The programmer states only what the result should look like, not how to obtain it. No loops, no assignments, etc. Whatever engine that interprets this code is just supposed go get the desired information, and can use whatever approach it wants.
