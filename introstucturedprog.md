##What is a paradigma?:
###We can speak of a paradigm as a set of beliefs, practices and knowledge that guide the development of a discipline over a period of time. In various branches of science, a set of ideas in force can be drastically replaced by another that conflicts with it and proves more accurate. Programming has its own paradigms, but the term "programming paradigm" does not necessarily represent a single model that must be respected until a better one appears. In fact, many paradigms currently coexist in harmony.
