## What is a paradigms?:
We can speak of a paradigm as a set of beliefs, practices and knowledge that guide the development of a discipline over a period of time. In various branches of science, a set of ideas in force can be drastically replaced by another that conflicts with it and proves more accurate. Programming has its own paradigms, but the term "programming paradigm" does not necessarily represent a single model that must be respected until a better one appears. In fact, many paradigms currently coexist in harmony.

## Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features.
### Declarative: 
Programming by specifying the result you want, not how to get it. The programmer states only what the result should look like, not how to obtain it. No loops, no assignments, etc. Whatever engine that interprets this code is just supposed go get the desired information, and can use whatever approach it wants.

## Data Representation
- Identifier: is a string of alphanumeric characters that begins with an alphabetic character or an underscore character that are used to represent various programming elements such as variables, functions, arrays, structures, unions and so on.
- Variables:  is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program.
- Constants:  is a value that cannot be altered by the program during normal execution.
- Reserved Words: are terms or phrases appropriated for special use that may not be utilized in the creation of variable names.
- Types of data: is a type together with a collection of operations to manipulate the type.
  - Primitive: are predefined types of data, which are supported by the programming language. 
    - Boolean (e.g. True or False)
    - Character (e.g. abc)
    - Date (e.g. 03/01/2017)
    - Double (e.g. 1.87651234355743E308)
    - Floating-point number (e.g. 1.23)
    - Integer (e.g. 123)
    - Long (e.g. 123456789)
    - Short (e.g. 0)
    - String (e.g. abc)
    - Void (e.g. no data)
  - Composite: is one whose values are composed of component values. One example is an array.
  - Abstract : are mathematical models of a set of data values or information that share similar behavior or qualities and that can be specified and identified independent of specific implementations. An abstract data type is defined in term of its data items or its associated operations rather than by its implementation.  
- Memory space for each data type:
  - Character: 1 byte
  - Unsigned character: 1 byte
  - Signed Character: 1 byte
  - Integer: 2 or 4 bytes
  - Unsigned Integer: 2 or 4 bytes
  - Short: 2 bytes
  - Unsigned Short: 2 bytes
  - Long: 8 bytes
  - Unsigned Long: 8 bytes
- Range of values of each data type:
  - Character: -128 to 127 or 0 to 255
  - Unsigned character: 0 to 255
  - Signed Character: -128 to 127
  - Integer: -32,768 to 32,767 or -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
  - Unsigned Integer: 0 to 65,535 or 0 to 4,294,967,295
  - Short: -32,768 to 32,767
  - Unsigned Short: 0 to 65,535
  - Long: -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807
  - Unsigned Long: 0 to 18446744073709551615
- Data type conversion: refers to either implicitly or explicitly changing a value from one data type storage format to another, e.g. a 16-bit integer to a 32-bit integer.
